# Mauro Tortonesi's Zsh Configuration

This is my Zsh configuration. I took [Mark Tran's configuration](https://github.com/marktran/zsh.d "Mark Tran's zsh.d GitHub
repository."), changed it to suit my needs (that is, I added support for RVM, configured ZLE for Vi mode, etc.) and added an
[Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh "Oh-My-Zsh GitHub repository.")-inspired installation procedure.


# Installation procedure
